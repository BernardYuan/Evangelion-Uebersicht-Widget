# Evangelion-Übersicht-Widget

## Instruction

For those who have trouble with clicking, please check your Übersicht settings.

The interface is MULTI-LANGUAGE! So don't worry if you don't speak German. Supported languages:
* Deutsch
* English

## Click to update!
Starting from 0.X8a, you can update Evangelion Übersicht Widget by clicking the update button! Not that there will be frequent updates, but it saves time. I'll try out some ways to make updating even cooler, given time that is.

## Major Update Notice!
If you are using an earlier version of this widget (before 0.X2a), please consider installing the versions after 0.X2a. I managed to solve the performance problem, now in alert mode it will only require 10% of the earlier version's energy, and 20% of the earlier version's CPU!

## About
This widget is an Evangelion Übersicht Widget, displaying information through a huge amount of cells on your desktop.

If you leaves nothing on your desktop except for less than six mounted volumes (system volumes, connected servers etc.), this widget can replace your desktop completely.

Currently with this widget you can:

1. View time
2. Check CPU and memory usage (Memory usage here includes cache usage, so it might come over 100%)
3. Check battery status
4. Check you Trash size
5. Check your public ip address
6. Control your iTunes, show current artist and title, and Album cover
7. Show first 5 of all your mounted volumes in alphabetical order
8. Show network traffic
9. Alert on DoNotDisturb mode
10. Vocal notice on alerts. Default is OFF, turn it on by setting config.Voice to true

Special features
* Update button displayed when new version is out
* Alarm system, triggers when CPU usage is too high or battery drops to below 20% without charging
* Empty your trash bin by clicking the trash cell
* Open up a volume by clicking it

Feedback

* Please note that this widget is still under development and open for suggestions. If you have any idea on how to improve this widget or new features you would like to see, please do not hesitate to contact me.
* If you are encountering any problem with the display, please click cell number 32 and see the original console output and contact me with the information you see in the output, otherwise it could be hard to determine what went wrong.
